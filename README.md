## About

Varuna is a general-purpose compiled programming language.
The implementation of the language can be found in this repository.
More specifically, this compiler is an LLVM front-end.
It produces (optionally) optimized LLVM IR.

WORK IN PROGRESS. Master branch contains stable, but very outdated and unfunctional code.
Wait for 0.1 release (coming soon(tm)) or grab the code from the develop branch.

## Language tutorial

WORK IN PROGRESS.

A quick guide can be found from quick-guide.md

## Building

### Requirements

The project is developed on Ubuntu 16.04 and tested on Ubuntu 14.04.
Other Linux distributions should work, as long as they'll have the right compiler versions available.
Windows is supported, and macOS may work, but is not tested due to lack of resources.

A C++14 compliant compiler is required for building.
The project is confirmed to build on
Linux with g++ (versions 5.4.0 and 6.2.0) and Clang (versions 3.6.2 and 3.8.0) and
on Windows with Visual Studio 14 (2015). Older compilers may work, but are not actively supported.
Further support is not planned.

This project depends on LLVM. It is developed on version 3.9, but earlier versions may work as well.
The command line flag -DLLVM_DIR can be used if CMake cannot find the LLVM installation from your system.

### Instructions

The application can be built using CMake.
The easiest way to do this is to run `build.sh`,
which will build the application, tests and documentation.
`build.sh` will only work on Linux.

If you'd like to build on other platforms than Linux,
or not to build documentation, here are the instructions:

### Linux

```sh
# On the repository root folder
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-3.9/lib/cmake/llvm ..
$ make

# Run tests:
$ cd ..
$ ./bin/tests

# Build documentation
$ ./build-docs.sh
```

### Windows

You can either use the CMake GUI or the Command Prompt:
```sh
# On the repository root folder
> md build
> cd build
> cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

After that the Visual Studio project files can be found in the folder `build`.

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md

## Compiler documentation

Compiler documentation is autogenerated by Doxygen. Its build can be triggered with the script `scripts/doxygen.sh`
After that the docs can be found in HTML and LaTEX formats in the folder `doc`.

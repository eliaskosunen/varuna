## About

Varuna is a general-purpose compiled programming language.
The implementation of the language can be found in this repository.
More specifically, this compiler is an LLVM front-end.
It produces either native object code, assembly or LLVM IR or bytecode.

WORK IN PROGRESS. 0.1 release is coming soon.

## Language tutorial

WORK IN PROGRESS.

A quick guide can be found from quick-guide.md

## Usage

The compiler compiles a Varuna source file (or *module*) to
a native object file `.o` (or optionally some other format) and
a Varuna module file `.vamod` (used for importing).

### Compiling a Varuna program

Building a Varuna program is currently not very user-friendly as you'll have to link the object files manually using the linker of your operating system.

```sh
# Produces program.o
$ varuna program.va
# Link the object files
# This example uses gcc
$ gcc program.o -lvart -lvacstd -o a.out
# Run it!
$ ./a.out
```

## Building

### Requirements

The project is developed on Ubuntu 16.04 and tested on Ubuntu 12.04.
Other Linux distributions should work, as long as they'll have the right compiler and library versions available.
Building on Windows is supported and tested on Win10.
Building on Mac OS X is supported and tested.

This project depends on LLVM and needs the LLVM compiler infrastructure C++ libraries.
The project is developed on version 4.0 and guaranteed to work only on that version.
The command line flag -DLLVM_DIR can be used if CMake cannot find the LLVM installation from your system.

To build the compiler, a C++14 standard compliant compiler is required. This means g++-5 or up (g++-4.9 may work) or clang++-3.6 or up.
On Windows, Visual Studio 14 (2015) or up is supported.

### Installing LLVM

The easiest way to install LLVM, if you are on Debian/Ubuntu, is to install them with `apt-get`. ([More information on the LLVM webpage](http://apt.llvm.org/)). First, add the apt repository:

```
# Debian (Jessie)
deb http://apt.llvm.org/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie-4.0 main
deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie-4.0 main
# Ubuntu (Xenial)
deb http://apt.llvm.org/xenial/ llvm-toolchain-xenial-4.0 main
deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/xenial/ llvm-toolchain-xenial-4.0 main
# See instructions for other OS versions from the link above
```

Then do the rest of the installation in the shell:

```sh
# Add sources (see above)
$ echo "deb http://apt.llvm.org/xenial/ llvm-toolchain-xenial-4.0 main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
$ echo "deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/xenial/ llvm-toolchain-xenial-4.0 main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null

# Retrieve archive signature
$ wget -O - http://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Update package lists
$ sudo apt-get update

# Install packages
$ sudo apt-get install libllvm4.0 llvm-4.0 llvm-4.0-dev

# LLVM packages will be on /usr/lib/llvm-4.0
```

On other platforms, you'll need to build LLVM yourself.
See the LLVM documentation:
[Linux](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html)
[Windows](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStartedVS.html)
[Downloads](releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.0)

### Other dependencies

Make sure to update submodules before building

```sh
$ git submodule update --init
```

On Linux, you'll also need to install libuuid.
The library files are already installed on some distributions, but the header files may be missing.
Libuuid is not required on Windows or Mac.

```sh
# Debian-based
$ sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
```

### Actual building

#### Linux

```sh
# On the repository root folder
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
# Your LLVM installation directory may be different
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-4.0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF ..
# Parallel builds are recommended
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

#### Windows

You can use the CMake GUI to create the MSVC project files.
Note that the tests don't support Windows.

## Editor support

An Atom package for Varuna syntax highlighting can be found here: https://github.com/varuna-lang/atom-language-varuna

## Compiler documentation

Compiler documentation is autogenerated by Doxygen. Its build can be triggered with the script `scripts/doxygen.sh`
After that the docs can be found in HTML and LaTEX formats in the folder `doc`.

WORK IN PROGRESS.
The documentation is lacking in various sections.
